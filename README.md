# Candy Crush with React

Im trying a tutorial where we create a replica of candy crush game with react

## How to download and run

You can download the project from github or if you have git in your local computer you can clone this repo with `git clone "https://github.com/charint4/candy-crush" `

You also need to install npm so you can run `npm install` on your terminal.
After that you just need to run `npm run start` on terminal to run the project.

## How to play

The game play is same as original candy crush where you can drag a candy image to adjacent side which is top, right, left, or bottom which make the candy color match three or four. If you dragged a candy where its not gonna be a match of three or above, the candy won't move.
